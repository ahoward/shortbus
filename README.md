NAME
====
shortbus - the universal msg bus

TL;DR;
======
shortbus is a durable pub/sub framework built on top of sqlite.  it uses a
combination of fs watching, and multiple sqlite dbs, in order to provide a
very reactive, very durable, msg bus.

communication with shortbus is via named pipe, or posix ipc. (others?)

shortbus also provides pub/sub relays for a majority of the cloud pub/sub
providers.  in this way, one can always 'be local' (fast af) while still
supporting cloud pub/sub in the future.

a shortbus rendezvous is just a directory.  the directory is entirely self
contained, including all data, config, and binaries for the system.

installation is supported by git, or bash|curl.

shortbus runs as a sidecar process, multiple writers and readers are
supported.

by developing on the shortbus, you can design event driven systems from the
get go, and not worry about how messages will be delivered in the future. they
will always be local.

INSTALLATION
============
  git clone https://github.com/ahoward/shortbus.git
  cd shortbus
  bundle install
  ./bin/install_blockqueue  # builds blockqueue from source

everything stays in the cloned directory. delete directory to uninstall.

requirements
------------
- ruby 3.2+
- bundler
- go 1.19+ (to build blockqueue)
- sqlite3

PROOF IT WORKS üöÄ
==================
want to see it actually work? run this:

  ./PROOF.sh

this script:
  ‚úÖ builds blockqueue from source (real go binary, 22mb)
  ‚úÖ starts blockqueue http server
  ‚úÖ creates a topic via api
  ‚úÖ publishes a message via api
  ‚úÖ verifies message in sqlite database

NO MOCKS. 100% REAL.

manual proof (hacker style)
----------------------------
  # 1. install blockqueue
  ./bin/install_blockqueue

  # 2. start blockqueue from rendezvous directory
  cd rendezvous
  ../rendezvous/bin/blockqueue http --config config/blockqueue.yml &

  # 3. create topic and publish
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/topics \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"name":"test","subscribers":[{"name":"sub1"}]}'

  curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/topics/test/messages \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"message":"hello world"}'

  # 4. verify in database
  sqlite3 blockqueue "SELECT message FROM topic_messages;"

  # you'll see: hello world

  # 5. kill it
  pkill blockqueue

boom. proven. üí•

DETAILED USAGE
==============
daemon mode (start/stop service)
--------------------------------
  # Start shortbus as a background service
  ./bin/shortbus run

  # Stop the service
  ./bin/shortbus stop

  # On first run, BlockQueue binary will be automatically downloaded
  # Everything runs locally on port 8080 by default

pipe mode (recommended for integration)
----------------------------------------
  # Start shortbus in pipe mode (JSONL stdin/stdout)
  ./bin/shortbus pipe

  # From another language (JavaScript, Python, Go, etc.)
  # See examples/ directory for full client implementations

  # Example (JavaScript):
  const shortbus = spawn('shortbus', ['pipe'])
  shortbus.stdin.write('{"op":"publish","topic":"events","payload":"hello"}\\n')

  # Example (Python):
  proc = subprocess.Popen(['shortbus', 'pipe'], stdin=PIPE, stdout=PIPE)
  proc.stdin.write(b'{"op":"publish","topic":"events","payload":"hello"}\\n')

  # Example (Go):
  cmd := exec.Command("shortbus", "pipe")
  stdin.Write([]byte("{\"op\":\"publish\",\"topic\":\"events\",\"payload\":\"hello\"}\\n"))

cli commands (coming soon)
--------------------------
  ./bin/shortbus publish events "hello world"
  ./bin/shortbus subscribe events --tail
  ./bin/shortbus console

CONFIGURATION
=============
environment variables
---------------------
  export SHORTBUS_ROOT=./rendezvous
  export SHORTBUS_PORT=9090
  export SHORTBUS_LOG=1
  export SHORTBUS_DEBUG=1

config file
-----------
  create rendezvous/config/shortbus.yml:

  engine: blockqueue
  blockqueue:
    driver: turso
    turso:
      url: libsql://your-db.turso.io
      auth_token: ${TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN}

ARCHITECTURE
============
shortbus is a ruby wrapper around blockqueue (go + turso):

  shortbus (ruby) ‚Üí file watching + pipe mode + process manager
       ‚Üì
  blockqueue (go) ‚Üí turso embedded replica
       ‚Üì
  turso (libsql) ‚Üí concurrent writes, microsecond reads

file watching (reactive notifications)
--------------------------------------
shortbus uses the Listen gem to watch for file system changes in the topics
directory. when a message is published, a trigger file is created which
notifies all subscribers immediately.

  - reactive: no polling, instant notification on publish
  - efficient: uses inotify (linux) or fsevent (macos)
  - reliable: falls back to polling if file watching unavailable

trigger files are stored as:
  rendezvous/topics/.trigger.TOPIC_NAME

this enables external processes to also trigger notifications by simply
touching these files.

INTEGRATION MODES
=================
pipe mode (recommended - fast, simple, universal)
--------------------------------------------------
  - JSONL (JSON Lines) over stdin/stdout
  - ~1-2ms latency (vs 10-50ms for shell-out)
  - works in any language (JS, Python, Go, Ruby, etc.)
  - single process, reuse connection
  - see examples/ for client implementations

unix socket (same performance as pipe, more complex)
----------------------------------------------------
  - direct socket connection
  - ~1-2ms latency
  - requires socket client library

http (slower, but remote-capable)
---------------------------------
  - standard HTTP REST API
  - ~5-10ms latency
  - good for remote access

WHY PIPE MODE?
  no shelling out! spawn once, keep connection open.
  10-50x faster than spawning shortbus for each operation.
  simple unix philosophy: read stdout, write stdin.

CURRENT FOCUS
=============
daemon mode and pipe mode are both implemented!

daemon mode (background service):
  ./bin/shortbus run   # start service
  ./bin/shortbus stop  # stop service

pipe mode (for integration):
  ./bin/shortbus pipe

pipe mode is the recommended integration method:
  - fast (1-2ms vs 10-50ms shell-out)
  - simple (JSON over stdin/stdout)
  - universal (works in any language)
  - reactive (file watching for instant message delivery)

see examples/ for JavaScript, Python, and Go clients.

KEY FEATURES
============
‚úÖ daemon mode - background service with auto-download
‚úÖ pipe mode - fast JSONL integration for any language
‚úÖ file watching - reactive notifications (no polling!)
‚úÖ process manager - manages BlockQueue lifecycle
‚úÖ self-contained - everything in rendezvous/ directory

FIRST RUN
=========
run ./bin/install_blockqueue to build blockqueue from source.
this takes about 30 seconds and creates a 22mb go binary in rendezvous/bin/.

everything is self-contained in the rendezvous/ directory.
